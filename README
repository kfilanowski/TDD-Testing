# Description
This program uses Test Driven Development to test two files: make_poem.js and
data_structures.js. We use unit testing with various data inputs to test
every function. There should be 100% code coverage.

# Contents
- make_poem.js: A program that reads a text file and generates a poem from it
  from given input

- data_structures.js: Contains required methods and functions to run
  make_poem.js.

- tests_make_poem.js: A file containing the unit tests for all the functions
  that calls make_poem to ensure that they function as intended.

- tests_data_structures.js: A file containing the unit tests for all of the
  functions that calls data_structures to ensure that they function as intended.

#  HOW-TO Run Tests
To run the test for the data_structures.js file, run the following command:
```npm run test_data_structures```

To run the test for the make_poem.js file, run the following command:
```npm run test_make_poem```

# HOW-TO Run Coverage
To run the coverage for the data_structures.js file, run the following command:
```npm run coverage_data_structures```

To run the coverage for the make_poem.js file, run the following command:
```npm run coverage_make_poem```
